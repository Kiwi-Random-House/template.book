# Using Appendices {#appendix-ref-label}

Information that is not essential to explain your findings, but that supports
your analysis (especially repetitive or lengthy information), validates your
conclusions or pursues a related point should be placed in an appendix (plural
appendices). Sometimes excerpts from this supporting information (i.e. part of
the data set) will be placed in the body of the report but the complete set of
information (i.e. all of the data set) will be included in the appendix.
Examples of information that could be included in an appendix include
figures/tables/charts/graphs of results, statistics, questionnaires, transcripts
of interviews, pictures, lengthy derivations of equations, maps, drawings,
letters, specification or data sheets, computer program information.

There is no limit to what can be placed in the appendix providing it is relevant
and reference is made to it in the report. The appendix is not a catch net for
all the semi-interesting or related information you have gathered through your
research for your report: the information included in the appendix must bear
directly relate to the research problem or the report's purpose. It must be a
useful tool for the reader (Weaver & Weaver, 1977).

Each separate appendix should be lettered (Appendix A, Appendix B, Appendix B1,
Appendix B2, Appendix C, etc). The order they are presented in is dictated by
the order they are mentioned in the text of the report. It is essential to refer
to each appendix within the text of the report; for example,

> For the manufacturer's specification, see [Appendix B](#appendix-ref-label)

or

> Appendix C contains the YoY shareholder account growth rates. The rates are
high. The increasing growth rate of accounts will significantly affect the
valuation of the company.
