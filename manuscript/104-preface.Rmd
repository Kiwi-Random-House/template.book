# Preface {-}

<!-- 
The preface should be about the book: 
* why it was written, 
* who it is for, 
* its organization, or the selection of contributors. 

Tips:

* An introduction to the subject of the book does not belong in the front
matter, but should appear as the first chapter of the book.
* A preface should not contain a reference list.
* Acknowledgment of support or assistance in preparing the book can be included
as the last paragraph(s) of the preface.
* If the acknowledgement is longer than one page, start a separate page with the
heading “Acknowledgements”.

## Colophon {-}

This book was written in [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/) using
[bookdown](http://bookdown.org/). The [website](http://mastering-shiny.org/) is
hosted with [netlify](http://netlify.com/), and automatically updated after
every commit by [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/). The complete source is
available from [GitHub](https://github.com/Kiwi-Random-House/template.book).

This version of the book was built with `r R.version.string` and the following
packages:

```{r get_book_packages, echo = FALSE, results="asis", cache = FALSE}
imports <- subset(DESCRIPTION$get_deps(), type == "Imports", "package", TRUE)
pkgs <- sessioninfo::package_info(sort(imports), dependencies = FALSE)
df <- tibble::tibble(
  package = pkgs$package,
  version = pkgs$ondiskversion,
  source = gsub("@", "\\\\@", pkgs$source)
)
knitr::kable(df, format = "markdown")
```
