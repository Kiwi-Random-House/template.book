What Structure Overview

Chapters contain the actual content of the book, i.e., text, figures, tables,
and references. Chapters can be grouped together in parts; subparts are not
possible. Only one chapter (e.g. an introduction) may precede the first part and
would be the first chapter.

* Decide the numbering style for the chapters and apply this style consistently
to all chapters: consecutively numbered (monographs or textbooks) or unnumbered
(contributed volumes).

* If an introduction to the subject of the book (historical background,
definitions, or methodology) is included, it should appear as the first chapter
and thus be included in the chapter numbering. It can contain references,
figures, and tables, just as any other chapter.

## Abstract

<!--
Begin each chapter with an abstract that summarizes the content of the chapter
in 150 to 250 (aim at 200) words. 

If no abstract is submitted, the first paragraph of the chapter is viewd as
abstract instead.

Tip:

* Donâ€™t include reference citations or undefined abbreviations in the abstract,
since abstracts are often read independently of the actual chapter and without
access to the reference list.
