# Preface {-}

<!-- 
The preface should be about the book: 
* why it was written, 
* who it is for, 
* its organization, or the selection of contributors. 

Tips:

* An introduction to the subject of the book does not belong in the front
matter, but should appear as the first chapter of the book.
* A preface should not contain a reference list.
* Acknowledgment of support or assistance in preparing the book can be included
as the last paragraph(s) of the preface.
* If the acknowledgement is longer than one page, start a separate page with the
heading “Acknowledgements”.
