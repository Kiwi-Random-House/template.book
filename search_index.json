You can do it either: Directly from GitHub by pushing changes into a new branch call develop; or Through SourceTree by: Cloning the repo to local computer through SourceTree; Initiating Git-flow; and Starting a new release named book-inception. At this stage of using the template, there are several items we can update: Rename template.book.Rproj to &lt;book-name&gt;.Rproj; and Update the Title, Description and Date fields in DESCRIPTION. Finally commit the changes: If you use GitHub website, then push the changes to the develop branch and merge the master branch. If you use SourceTree, then finish the release and push changes to remote. The first deployment takes ~9 minutes to complete. At the end of a successful run, two new branches appear in the GitHub repo: gh-pages and gh-preview. 1.6 Link the Book with Netlify Go to https://app.netlify.com/; and Follow the illustrations. Modify the following by clicking on “Build settings” at the right navigation bar. Then, click “Edit settings” under “Deploy contexts”: Set “Production branch” to gh-pages; Set “Branch deploys” to “Let me add individual branches”; and Add gh-preview under “Additional branches”. 1.7 Update Site Name on Netlify 1.8 Update Netlify Fields within DESCRIPTION Update NetlifyURL with the site URL; and Update NetlifyID with API ID. 1.9 Update GitHub README File Render README.Rmd in R Push changes Congratulations, you’ve made it!

["A-appendix-ref-label.html", "Appendix A Using Appendices", " Appendix A Using Appendices Information that is not essential to explain your findings, but that supports your analysis (especially repetitive or lengthy information), validates your conclusions or pursues a related point should be placed in an appendix (plural appendices). Sometimes excerpts from this supporting information (i.e. part of the data set) will be placed in the body of the report but the complete set of information (i.e. all of the data set) will be included in the appendix. Examples of information that could be included in an appendix include figures/tables/charts/graphs of results, statistics, questionnaires, transcripts of interviews, pictures, lengthy derivations of equations, maps, drawings, letters, specification or data sheets, computer program information. There is no limit to what can be placed in the appendix providing it is relevant and reference is made to it in the report. The appendix is not a catch net for all the semi-interesting or related information you have gathered through your research for your report: the information included in the appendix must bear directly relate to the research problem or the report’s purpose. It must be a useful tool for the reader (Weaver &amp; Weaver, 1977). Each separate appendix should be lettered (Appendix A, Appendix B, Appendix B1, Appendix B2, Appendix C, etc). The order they are presented in is dictated by the order they are mentioned in the text of the report. It is essential to refer to each appendix within the text of the report; for example, For the manufacturer’s specification, see Appendix A or Appendix C contains the YoY shareholder account growth rates. The rates are high. The increasing growth rate of accounts will significantly affect the valuation of the company. "],
