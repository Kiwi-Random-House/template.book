You can do it either: Directly from GitHub by pushing changes into a new branch call develop; or Through SourceTree by: Cloning the repo to local computer through SourceTree; Initiating Git-flow; and Starting a new release named book-inception. At this stage of using the template, there are several items we can update: Rename template.book.Rproj to &lt;book-name&gt;.Rproj; and Update the Title, Description and Date fields in DESCRIPTION. Finally commit the changes: If you use GitHub website, then push the changes to the develop branch and merge the master branch. If you use SourceTree, then finish the release and push changes to remote. The first deployment takes ~9 minutes to complete. At the end of a successful run, two new branches appear in the GitHub repo: gh-pages and gh-preview. 1.6 Link the Book with Netlify Go to https://app.netlify.com/; and Follow the illustrations. Modify the following by clicking on “Build settings” at the right navigation bar. Then, click “Edit settings” under “Deploy contexts”: Set “Production branch” to gh-pages; Set “Branch deploys” to “Let me add individual branches”; and Add gh-preview under “Additional branches”. 1.7 Update Site Name on Netlify 1.8 Update Netlify Fields within DESCRIPTION Update NetlifyURL with the site URL; and Update NetlifyID with API ID. 1.9 Update GitHub README File Render README.Rmd in R Push changes Congratulations, you’ve made it!
