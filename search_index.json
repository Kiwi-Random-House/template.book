Add PAT as an environment variable named GITHUB_PAT within project setting. 1.4 Set SSH key pair via travis Only needed when deploying from builds on Travis CI or GitHub Actions. # Install travis R package remotes::install_github(&quot;ropenscilabs/travis&quot;) # Generate SSH travis::browse_travis_token() travis::use_travis_deploy() 1.5 Trigger Travis to Deploy the Book Trigger the first deployment on the master and develop branches. You can do it either: Directly from GitHub by pushing changes into a new branch call develop; or Through SourceTree by: Cloning the repo to local computer through SourceTree; Initiating Git-flow; and Starting a new release named book-inception. At this stage of using the template, there are several items we can update: Rename template.book.Rproj to &lt;book-name&gt;.Rproj; and Update the Title, Description and Date fields in DESCRIPTION. Finally commit the changes: If you use GitHub website, then push the changes to the develop branch and merge the master branch. If you use SourceTree, then finish the release and push changes to remote. The first deployment takes ~9 minutes to complete. At the end of a successful run, two new branches appear in the GitHub repo: gh-pages and gh-preview. 1.6 Link the Book with Netlify Go to https://app.netlify.com/; and Follow the illustrations. Modify the following by clicking on “Build settings” at the right navigation bar. Then, click “Edit settings” under “Deploy contexts”: Set “Production branch” to gh-pages; Set “Branch deploys” to “Let me add individual branches”; and Add gh-preview under “Additional branches”. 1.7 Update Site Name on Netlify 1.8 Update Netlify Fields within DESCRIPTION Update NetlifyURL with the site URL; and Update NetlifyID with API ID. 1.9 Update GitHub README File Render README.Rmd in R Push changes Congratulations, you’ve made it!

["2-intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 Terminology 2.2 Useful Materials 2.3 Prerequisites 2.4 Example", " Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 Terminology The following terms come up repeatedly in discussion of machine learning(Google 2018): Instance: The thing about which you want to make a prediction. For example, the instance might be a web page that you want to classify as either “about cats” or “not about cats”. Label: An answer for a prediction task; either the answer produced by a machine learning system, or the right answer supplied in training data. For example, the label for a web page might be “about cats”. Feature: A property of an instance used in a prediction task. For example, a web page might have a feature “contains the word ‘cat’”. Feature Column: A set of related features, such as the set of all possible countries in which users might live. An example may have one or more features present in a feature column. “Feature column” is Google-specific terminology. A feature column is referred to as a “namespace” in the VW system (at Yahoo/Microsoft), or a field. Example: An instance (with its features) and a label. Model: A statistical representation of a prediction task. You train a model on examples then use the model to make predictions. Metric: A number that you care about. May or may not be directly optimized. Objective: A metric that your algorithm is trying to optimize. Pipeline: The infrastructure surrounding a machine learning algorithm. Includes gathering the data from the front end, putting it into training data files, training one or more models, and exporting the models to production. 2.2 Useful Materials bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown papaja: Reproducible APA manuscripts with R Markdown 2.3 Prerequisites 2.4 Example You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 4. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!
